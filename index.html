	<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
	<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
	<p><strong>
	Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now.On her desk, Lying between the copies of <em>Nature,New Scientits</em>,and all the other<br />
	scientific jourmals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <em>On The Road.</em>It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she<br />
	spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
	</strong></p>
	<p><strong> 
	She had spent the last ten years in this room,sitting under aposter with an Oscar Wlide quote proclaiming that<q>Work is the refuge of people who have <br />
	nothing better to do</q>.Although many considered work,unravelling the secrets of the Ilama DNA,to be an outstanding achievement,Molly<br />
	<em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
